# what to do in 2018

## 1. learn this and prototype in js
even though i think these are garbage.
## 2. finish react-svg.js(40% finished)
however this is just a react-wrapper, a week is enough
## 3. algorithm
work hard and no play...
## 4. canvas learning
this is future?
##5. webpack??
do not like it
## 6. learn to write a loader like jsx-loader or etc
study function programing, should be interesting
